        Our Team
      </h3>
      <p>We are a <i>FIRST</i> robotics team from Salem High School, consisting of about 30 hard-working, dedicated students
        who are passionate about STEM. The team consists of all age groups from freshmen to seniors. We have a large
        variety of interests that all participate in meeting the expectations of the design process. We hope to combine
        our efforts in order to participate in the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition.</p>

          Automatically update the age of the team. Whenever someone updates the
          website, a rebuild will be triggered and this will update.

        year robotics team, we wish to expand in participation and membership. Gaining people with
        multifaceted abilities is such a important part of our academic and athletic foundation, as our school consists
        of high standards of athleticism. We also wish to prepare our members for their future careers with the skills
        they'll gain while working on the team. We hope to make this team a permanent part of the Spartan family.</p>

      <h3>
        Reaching Out
      </h3>
      <p>Our team continues to reach out into the community by connecting with the elementary students for little workshops
        --such as Hour of Code day. We have also visited them during their science fairs to show off the 2015 and 2016
        FRC robots. Our original robotics leader, Mrs. Gerrol, recently relocated to the middle school to teach technology
        and get the rising freshman classes familiar and excited about the robotics team. We hope to expand our participation
        in the community to prompt STEM interest and outreach.</p>

      <h3 class="text-secondary">FIRST</h3>
      <p>​<i>FIRST</i> is an organization that sets students up for a bright future in STEM. <i>FIRST</i> stands for For Inspiration
        and Recognition of Science and Technology. Dean Kamen is the founder and has been dedicated to promoting STEM for over 25 years.
        Dr. Woodie Flowers is the <i>FIRST</i> Distinguished Advisor who coined the term "Gracious Professionalism." "Gracious
        Professionalism" is winning in a respectable way. This teaches students how to be classy when competing in their
        competitions.

      <h3>
        Our League - FRC
      </h3>
      <p>​Our team participates in the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition (FRC), a competition league created by <i>FIRST</i>. This competition
        is available to grades nine through twelve. Every year, each team gathers to watch the kick off podcast that shows
        what the theme will be for that season and what the competition will consist of: shooting, hanging items, etc.
        From there, teams have six weeks to build and perfect their robot. FRC allows teams to use science, technology,
        engineering, and math (STEM) skills to plan, build, and strategize.</p>

      <h3>
        Team History
      </h3>
      <p> We started Spartan Robotics in 2015, so the 2025 season will be our eleventh year of competing in the <i>FIRST</i>
        Robotics Competition. In our first year we made a decent robot, but have expanded our technical abilities to design
        much more complex Robots. Our team started with 6 members and has grown into the 20's. We have particiipated in
        STEM events, Old Salem Days, the Salem Christmas Parade, and events at the Salem Red Sox park. We host the
        Blue Ridge Brawl each fall, an off season competition.</p>
