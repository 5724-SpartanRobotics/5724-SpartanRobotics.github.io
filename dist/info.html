        <p>We have two Presidents and two Vice Presidents. John Frazier and Yudel Martinez are the co-Presidents; David Winslow
          and Jacob Stewart are the Sr. Vice Presidents. All are in their senior year of high school, and all are pursuing
          a career in which the experience gained on this team will help prepare them dramatically.</p>

      <div class="team team-team">
        <h3>
          Our Team
        </h3>
        <p>We are a FIRST robotics team, consisting of 60 hard-working, dedicated students who are passionate about STEM related
          subjects from Salem High School. The team consists of all age groups from freshmen to seniors. We have a large
          variety of interests that all participate in meeting the expectations of the design process. We hope to combine
          our efforts in order to participate in the First Robotics Competition.</p>

      <div class="team team-vision">
        <h3>
          Our Vision
        </h3>
        <p>Building onto this fourth year robotics team, we wish to expand in participation and membership. Gaining people with
          multifaceted abilities is such a important part of our academic and athletic foundation, as our school consists
          of high standards of athleticism. We also wish to prepare our members for their future careers with the skills
          they'll gain while working on the team. We hope to make this team a permanent part of the Spartan family.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="team team-outreach">
        <h3>
          Reaching Out
        </h3>
        <p>Our team continues to reach out into the community by connecting with the elementary students for little workshops
          --such as Hour of Code day. We have also visited them during their science fairs to show off the 2015 and 2016
          FRC robots. Our original robotics leader, Mrs. Gerrol, recently relocated to the middle school to teach technology
          and get the rising freshman classes familiar and excited about the robotics team. We hope to expand our participation
          in the community to prompt STEM interest and outreach.</p>

        <p>​FIRST is an organization that sets students up for a bright future in STEM. FIRST stands for For Inspiration Recognition
          of Science and Technology. Dean Kamen is the founder and has been dedicated to promoting STEM for over 25 years.
          Dr. Woodie Flowers is the FIRST Distinguished Advisor who coined the term "Gracious Professionalism". "Gracious
          Professionalism" is winning in a respectable way. This teaches students how to be classy when competing in their
          competitions.

          Our League - FRC
        </h3>
        <p>​Our team participates in the First Robotics Competition (FRC), a competition league created by FIRST. This competition
          is available to grades nine through twelve. Every year, each team gathers to watch the kick off podcast that shows
          what the theme will be for that season and what the competition will consist of: shooting, hanging items, etc.
          From there, teams have six weeks to build and perfect their robot. FRC allows teams to use science, technology,
          engineering, and math (STEM) skills to plan, build, and strategize.</p>

          Team History
        </h3>
        <p> We started Spartan Robotics in 2015, but now it is our fourth year of competing in FIRST Robotics Competition. In
          our first year we made a decent robot, but now we are making the best, most expensive robot that our team has ever
          made. We have grown so much from having just 6 members to having almost 40 members! Last year, for the first time
          in our team’s history, we became an alliance captain in one of our competitions. We have also been in the Salem
          Christmas Parade twice. We will continue to grow in our abilities as more people with diverse interests join throughout
          the years.</p>
