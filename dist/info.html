        <p>We have two Presidents and two Vice Presidents. John Frazier and Yudel Martinez are the Co-Presidents; David Winslow
          and Jacob Stewart are the Sr. Vice Presidents. All are in their senior year of high school, and all are pursuing
          a career in which the experience gained on this team will help prepare them dramatically.</p>

      <div class="team team-team">
        <h3>
          Our Team
        </h3>
        <p>We are a <i>FIRST</i> robotics team from Salem High School, consisting of about 30 hard-working, dedicated students
          who are passionate about STEM. The team consists of all age groups from freshmen to seniors. We have a large
          variety of interests that all participate in meeting the expectations of the design process. We hope to combine
          our efforts in order to participate in the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="team team-vision">
        <h3>
          Our Vision
        </h3>
        <p>Building onto this fourth year robotics team, we wish to expand in participation and membership. Gaining people with
          multifaceted abilities is such a important part of our academic and athletic foundation, as our school consists
          of high standards of athleticism. We also wish to prepare our members for their future careers with the skills
          they'll gain while working on the team. We hope to make this team a permanent part of the Spartan family.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="team team-outreach">
        <h3>
          Reaching Out
        </h3>
        <p>Our team continues to reach out into the community by connecting with the elementary students for little workshops
          --such as Hour of Code day. We have also visited them during their science fairs to show off the 2015 and 2016
          FRC robots. Our original robotics leader, Mrs. Gerrol, recently relocated to the middle school to teach technology
          and get the rising freshman classes familiar and excited about the robotics team. We hope to expand our participation
          in the community to prompt STEM interest and outreach.</p>

        <h3 class="text-secondary">FIRST</h3>
        <p>​<i>FIRST</i> is an organization that sets students up for a bright future in STEM. <i>FIRST</i> stands for For Inspiration
          and Recognition of Science and Technology. Dean Kamen is the founder and has been dedicated to promoting STEM for over 25 years.
          Dr. Woodie Flowers is the <i>FIRST</i> Distinguished Advisor who coined the term "Gracious Professionalism." "Gracious
          Professionalism" is winning in a respectable way. This teaches students how to be classy when competing in their
          competitions.

        <h3>
          Our League - FRC
        </h3>
        <p>​Our team participates in the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition (FRC), a competition league created by <i>FIRST</i>. This competition
          is available to grades nine through twelve. Every year, each team gathers to watch the kick off podcast that shows
          what the theme will be for that season and what the competition will consist of: shooting, hanging items, etc.
          From there, teams have six weeks to build and perfect their robot. FRC allows teams to use science, technology,
          engineering, and math (STEM) skills to plan, build, and strategize.</p>

      <div class="team team-history">
        <h3>
          Team History
        </h3>
        <p> We started Spartan Robotics in 2015, so the 2019 season will be our fifth year of competing in the <i>FIRST</i>
          Robotics Competition. In our first year we made a decent robot, but now we are making the best, most expensive robot that
          our team has ever made. We have grown so much from having just 6 members to having almost 30 members! Last year, for the
          first time in our team’s history, we became an alliance captain in one of our competitions. We have also been in the Salem
          Christmas Parade twice. We will continue to grow in our abilities as more people with diverse interests join throughout
          the years.</p>
