    Blue Ridge Brawl (CANCELLED FOR 2020!)
  </h1>

  <h1>Unfortunately, due to the Pandemic, the Blue Ridge Brawl (along will all
  offseason FIRST events) is cancelled for 2020. It is planned to occur again
  in 2021.</h1>

  <!--
    TODO: FOR THE PERSON UPDATING FOR 2021:
    pretty much everything below is commented out in three (I think?) main
    comment sections because the BRB was cancelled for 2020 because of The
    Pandemic. You will need to uncomment everything and update it all, and
    you are welcome to make it look nicer as well, but you don't have to.
    Also, even though all the other pages are removed from the navigation
    menu, they also have cancellation notices at the top of them because the
    pages still technically exist (didn't want to lose google search rankings,
    and someone could have linked to them somewhere and a 404 not found is not
    a very descriptive error). They need the cancellation notices removed when
    they are updated.
