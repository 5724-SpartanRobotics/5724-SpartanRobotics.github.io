### LEGO (EV3) ROBOTICS -

Campers who participate in the LEGO (EV3) summer camp have the opportunity to design, build and program robots using the fantastic EV3 LEGO robotics system. This camp is for beginners and will focus on the basics of robotics and programming. At the end of the week, campers will participate in a tournament to showcase what they have learned and accomplished during their week at camp.


### VEX ROBOTICS - 

Campers who participate in the Vex Robotics summer camp have the opportunity to design, build and program robots using the powerful Vex robotics system. This camp is for beginners and will focus on the basics of robotics and programming. At the end of the week, campers will participate in a tournament to showcase what they have learned and accomplished during their week at camp.


### CYBER DEFENSE -

Campers who participate in the Cyber Defense summer camp will learn about internet and computer security, how to secure a network, and how to defend themselves from cyber attacks. Campers are placed in the position of newly hired IT professionals tasked with managing the network of a small company. Students are given a set of virtual images that represent operating systems and are tasked with finding cyber security vulnerabilities within the images and hardening the system while maintaining critical services.


### Girls Who Code - 

Girls Who Code Camp is an introductory computer science program. Participants learn about computer science, gain exposure to tech jobs, and join a sisterhood of girls who are using computer science to become change-makers. Girls will learn through hands-on activities, coding, and robotics. Come join us for an exciting adventure in coding with your new coding sisterhood!


### Kid Wind - 
    
Explore the world of wind as you discover the properties and potential of moving air! Participants will investigate the ways that wind powers machines in daily hands-on experiments. Campers will harness the wind as they design and build a working small-scale windmill. Experience the engineering design process as you prepare for the Wonders of Wind Weightlifting Challenge!


### Intro to Programming -

Learn the basics of coding with fun hands-on and computer based learning.  We will learn to construct our own programs creatively in Scratch using block based programming, computational thinking with unplugged games, and practice paired-programming with Code.org, Kodable and more!


### Basics of Programming - 

Basics of Programming will build on the Intro to Programming option and will take a deeper dive into programming with a choose your own adventure model: learning game design with Gamechangineer, looping and conditionals in Scratch, Create a CS First Animation project or introduction to text based coding. This option pairs well with the Intro to Programming option for motivated campers and can be a great choice for campers with prior coding experience/high motivation.
