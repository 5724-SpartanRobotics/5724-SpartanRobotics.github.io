        Skip events that have already happened, but we still have to check in javascript
        because Jekyll only runs to rebuild the list when changes are made to the site.
        This converts the date (or end date, if there is one) of the event to seconds,
        adds 172800 seconds (2 days), and stores it in a variable called expireTime. It
        then does not add the event if the expireTime is less than the current time (or in
        other words, the expireTime has already passed). This makes sure that whenever
        the page is rebuilt, only events that are within two days of the beginning of
        their end date will show up.
