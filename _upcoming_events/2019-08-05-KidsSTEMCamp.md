Spartan Robotics will be hosting a Robotics Camp for Rising 4th through 6th graders Monday, August 5th through Friday, August 9th from 9am - 12pm at Andrew Lewis Middle School. The cost is $25.

The camp will provide an introduction to robotics concepts including design, building, programming, and strategy. Campers will build an autonomous LEGO Mindstorm robot to complete a variety of tasks ranging from simple movement to those involving logic and sensors. Prior experience with LEGO products/robotics programming is not required. On the last day of the camp, students will participate in a robot showcase. The camp will be staffed by the coaches and team members of the Spartan Robotics team from Salem High School.
