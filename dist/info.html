        <p>We have two Presidents and two Vice Presidents. John Frazier and Yudel Martinez are the co-Presidents; David Winslow
          and Jacob Stewart are the Sr. Vice Presidents. All are in their senior year of high school, and all are pursuing
          a career in which the experience gained on this team will help prepare them dramatically.</p>

        <h3>
          Our Team
        </h3>
        <p>We are a FIRST robotics team, consisting of 60 hard-working, dedicated students who are passionate about STEM related
          subjects from Salem High School. The team consists of all age groups from freshmen to seniors. We have a large
          variety of interests that all participate in meeting the expectations of the design process. We hope to combine
          our efforts in order to participate in the First Robotics Competition.</p>

      <div class="team team-vision">
        <h3>
          Our Vision
        </h3>
        <p>Building onto this fourth year robotics team, we wish to expand in participation and membership. Gaining people with
          multifaceted abilities is such a important part of our academic and athletic foundation, as our school consists
          of high standards of athleticism. We also wish to prepare our members for their future careers with the skills
          they'll gain while working on the team. We hope to make this team a permanent part of the Spartan family.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="team team-outreach">
        <h3>
          Reaching Out
        </h3>
        <p>Our team continues to reach out into the community by connecting with the elementary students for little workshops
          --such as Hour of Code day. We have also visited them during their science fairs to show off the 2015 and 2016
          FRC robots. Our original robotics leader, Mrs. Gerrol, recently relocated to the middle school to teach technology
          and get the rising freshman classes familiar and excited about the robotics team. We hope to expand our participation
          in the community to prompt STEM interest and outreach.</p>
